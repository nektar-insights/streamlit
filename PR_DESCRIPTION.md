# Streamlit Refactoring: Phases 3, 4, & 5 - Page Refactoring, Standardized Filters, and Chart Improvements

## Summary

This PR contains **Phases 3, 4, and 5** of the Streamlit refactoring effort, building on the foundation established in PR #2 (Phases 1 & 2). These changes deliver major code reduction, consistent UI/UX patterns, and improved data visualizations.

## What's Included

This PR contains **5 commits** with the following improvements:

### ðŸ”§ Phase 3A & 3B: Major Page Refactoring (Commit 1)
**Commit:** `f2f160d` - Phase 3A & 3B: Refactor all pages to use centralized utilities

- **pages/loan_tape.py**: Reduced from 1,487 lines to 969 lines
  - **518 lines removed (34.8% reduction)**
  - Moved all utility functions to centralized modules
  - Kept only page-specific visualization functions
  - Created backup file for safety

- **pages/capital_forecast.py**: Standardized preprocessing
  - Now uses `preprocess_dataframe()` from utils
  - Removed duplicate preprocessing logic

- **pages/qbo_dashboard.py**: Removed duplicate preprocessing
  - Eliminated 25-line `preprocess_financial_data()` function
  - Now uses centralized `preprocess_dataframe()` and `add_derived_date_features()`

- **TESTING_CHECKLIST.md**: Created comprehensive testing guide

**Impact:** ~700+ lines of duplicate code eliminated across the codebase

---

### ðŸ“¦ Housekeeping: Gitignore Update (Commit 2)
**Commit:** `15d1359` - Add backup files to gitignore

- Added `*.backup` to .gitignore
- Prevents tracking of backup files created during refactoring

---

### ðŸŽ¨ Phase 4: Standardized Filters (Commit 3)
**Commit:** `0eaa515` - Standardize date pickers and partner source filters

Created **3 reusable filter components** in `utils/display_components.py`:

1. **`create_date_range_filter()`**: Consistent date range picker with checkbox toggle
   - Handles timezone removal
   - Validates date ranges
   - Returns filtered DataFrame and active status

2. **`create_partner_source_filter()`**: Partner source multiselect
   - Sorted options
   - Configurable default selection
   - Returns filtered DataFrame and selected partners

3. **`create_status_filter()`**: Status selectbox with "All" option
   - Works with any status column
   - Consistent filtering pattern
   - Returns filtered DataFrame and selected status

**Updated Pages:**
- **pages/loan_tape.py**: Now uses all 3 standardized filters (date, partner, status)
- **pages/x_QA_audit.py**: Added partner source filter to missing loan IDs section

**Benefits:**
- Consistent UI/UX across all pages
- Reusable components reduce code duplication
- Easier to maintain and update filter behavior

### ðŸ“Š Phase 5A: Chart Date Formatting (Commit 4)
**Commit:** `c5e007d` - Improve chart date formatting and ML diagnostics visuals

**Chart Improvements:**
- Fixed date x-axis formatting on capital flow charts (`pages/loan_tape.py:176-215, 243-284`)
- **Eliminated duplicate dates** by aggregating daily data to monthly
- Updated to use `yearmonth()` encoding with proper format (`"%b %Y"`)
- Added points to line charts for better readability
- Pattern now matches good examples like "Monthly Participation Rate" charts

**Display Component Enhancements** (`utils/display_components.py`):
- Enhanced `create_time_series_chart()` with `aggregate_by` parameter ("day", "month", "quarter", "year")
- Added `create_monthly_time_series()` for multi-line monthly charts
- Both functions handle timezone removal and proper date formatting

**ML Diagnostics Enhancements** (`utils/loan_tape_ml.py`):
- Added `create_coefficient_chart()`: Horizontal bar charts for model coefficients
- Added `render_ml_explainer()`: Interactive explainer boxes with directionality guidance

**ML Tab Improvements** (`pages/loan_tape.py:953-1026`):
- Color-coded coefficient charts:
  - **Red** for risk-increasing features (red flags)
  - **Green** for risk-decreasing features (green flags)
- Directional indicators on metrics (â†‘/â†“)
- Expandable "ðŸ“– How to interpret these metrics" sections
- **Classification Metrics Explainer:**
  - ROC AUC: "Higher is better â†‘" (0.5-1.0 range explained)
  - Precision: "Higher is better â†‘" (minimizes false alarms)
  - Recall: "Higher is better â†‘" (minimizes missed problems)
  - Coefficient directionality explained
- **Regression Metrics Explainer:**
  - RÂ²: "Higher is better â†‘" (closer to 1.0 = better)
  - RMSE: "Lower is better â†“" (smaller error = better)
  - Coefficient interpretation

**Benefits:**
- Charts now have clean, readable date axes without duplicates
- ML metrics are intuitive with clear directional guidance
- Visual charts replace some tables for better understanding

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 5B: Complete Filter Rollout (Commit 5)
**Commit:** `ac1ca80` - Add consistent date and status filters to all pages

Added standardized filters to remaining pages:

**pages/capital_forecast.py:**
- Date filter: `date_created` (deals)
- Status filter: `dealstage` or `stage` (deals)
- Shows: "X of Y deals"

**pages/qbo_dashboard.py:**
- Date filter: `txn_date` (QBO transactions)
- Status filter: `txn_type` (transaction type)
- Shows: "X transactions"

**pages/x_QA_audit.py:**
- Date filter for Deals: `date_created`
- Date filter for QBO: `txn_date`
- Status filter: `dealstage` or `stage` (deals)
- Shows: "Deals: X of Y" and "QBO Txns: X of Y"

**Filter Consistency Across All Pages:**

| Page | Date Filter Field | Status Filter Field |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| loan_tape.py | `funding_date` | `loan_status` + `partner_source` |
| capital_forecast.py | `date_created` | `dealstage`/`stage` |
| qbo_dashboard.py | `txn_date` | `txn_type` |
| x_QA_audit.py | `date_created` + `txn_date` | `dealstage`/`stage` |

**Benefits:**
- Every page now has consistent filter UI
- Each page uses dataset-appropriate date fields
- Clear feedback on filter effects with record counts
